USAGE:
For example, scraping Apple's instagram:
Navigate to https://www.instagram.com/apple/ in a browser
Find JSON that contains strings that begins with this ...
{"status": "ok", "media":
I honeslty forget how I produced this JSON, I think I scrolled down the page until the lazy load loaded everything and built a JSON file. Writing this readme now I dont see it. Maybe they changed since I wrote this.
